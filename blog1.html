		<h1>Who we are and why this website?</h1>
			<h3>by citizen 01.12.2020</h3>

			<p>
				We are a four-man StarCraft II team who first met in the real world
				before connecting again online. There is no captain, which leads to
				constant bickering about strategy as well as the occasional tantrum. We live
				normal lives and do normal things. Basically we're just a coupla random
				dudes who like StarCraft II (except for reaperman, who is currently
				over it, again).
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently one of us took up programming and decided to create this
				website as a showcase of his skills. The term <i>The Overlords</i> was
				coined during the creation of the team's WhatsApp group. It seemed
				fitting to name the website the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fun fact: online we're not actually called The Overlords. That's too
				long for Blizzard. Our team is called Hyper1 (after Hyperion, which is
				also too long). Makes no sense, I know.
