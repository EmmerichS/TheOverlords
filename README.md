In 2020, during the Great Virus, I joined the Ivan on Tech Academy (now Moralis Academy) to educate myself on blockchain programming.
As I had absolutely no background in programming I had to do a preparatory course which included HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I created this very basic website to practice what I had learnt.
